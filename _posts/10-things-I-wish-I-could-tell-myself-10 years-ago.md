I have made quite a few mistakes in my academic and professional life. Phew. It feels good to be able to say it out loud (0 followers so it is fine). Some of those ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù are personality-driven; some of them are what I would call culture-driven. I am specifically referring to Indian culture and our mindset (could also apply to others). What I do mean by culture is rigorously following a set of steps that are often outlined by our family members or relatives who in turn outline them based on their forefathers or experience from a very different world. We expect that following these steps will result in instant success and we do not pay attention to the demands of a world that is constantly evolving and adapting.


Hindsight is an exact science, they say. I could not agree more. However, I also think that the gap between what you should have done and what you do can be minimized to a large extent. With that inspiration, I am penning down a few things I wish I could tell my younger self. FYI ‚Äî I am already working on course-correcting to the best of my ability and I do think that it‚Äôs okay to screw up. This is in no way a regret or a pity post (with hindsight and age also comes acceptance) ‚Äî the hope is that students and young professionals can keep in mind the do-nots from someone‚Äôs experience. Here goes:

1. Do not be afraid to ask for things (things = promotion or a higher pay or a different function of a combination of all three). So many of us are afraid that asking for these things will make our employers lose all respect for us and we‚Äôll never grow. Think of it this way ‚Äî if you do ask (obviously by giving a good reason!) and they agree, you win. If they do not agree and tell you why you do not deserve it ‚Äî you have learned something. If they do not agree and don‚Äôt you treat the same way ‚Äî start looking for a better employer

2. Network. Network. Build a network. You often hear this word and sure, it‚Äôs probably been abused a lot by now, but start surrounding yourself with people who are curious and passionate about the world. Do not be afraid to seek help from people who inspire you ‚Äî a teacher, someone working a top job in your neighbourhood, a distant relative, a college senior etc. Networking is for top of mind recall. Over the years, focus on building strong relationships. You don‚Äôt have to do that for everyone in your network ‚Äî focus your energy and time on a few good relationships ‚Äî you can‚Äôt image how much of dividend it will pay in your future

3. Learn to sell yourself. Even if it‚Äôs uncomfortable. (It IS uncomfortable). Expecting that you will be able to sail through based on just your talent is betting on really low probability. Try to make your discoverability high. Focus on things you like and are passionate about and TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT. A lot of us shy away from selling our skills unless it‚Äôs a job interview; experience will show that consistency will win over sheer talent on most days
4. Course correct and take risks when you are young. It‚Äôs okay to not know what your dream job is or what your ideal career trajectory should look like ‚Äî do not obsess over the right answer and keep trying new things. Luck won‚Äôt find you if you keep waiting for it. Consistent hard work and curiosity has a better chance of getting you lucky

5. Even if you do not belong to a brand name institute (I didn‚Äôt either) or have terrible teachers/academic infrastructure ‚Äî focus on learning your subject. Do not waste 4 years of your life. I spent all my time reading classical fiction on Kindle and I really wish I‚Äôd spent some time learning my subjects. I spend a lot more time revisiting those now and find it SO MUCH MORE interesting ‚Äî I am simply accessing better resources to understand them. So, focus on finding better resources or ways to learn but learn

6. Get internships or start a side project or if you can, start a side hustle. Do not focus too much on degrees. Those are only for getting you through the door. Projects/internships can do that AND get you that dream job. Find people with similar interests and build something with them. Exchange ideas ‚Äî you never know when you get ‚Äúlucky‚Äù

7. Whatever you are learning or doing ‚Äî try and learn to code. Get yourself educated on technology and software, to whatever extent you can. The largest technological innovations in the last two decades have been possible because of code and it will continue to dominate our foreseeable future. Try to take a part in it

8. Try not to be a generalist. Find one niche. Or a couple of niches. It‚Äôs okay to change them but the world will reward you better for being really good at a few skills than being mediocre at 20 skills

9. Do not compare and over think. Don‚Äôt treat everyone else‚Äôs career graph as your own ultimate checklist. Focus instead on finding a job that makes you happy. Remember that this is your personal journey ‚Äî it does not need to follow someone else‚Äôs storyline

10. Seek feedback constantly. I have often disregarded asking for feedback but it‚Äôs so, so important. Even if you do not agree with the feedback, take it, and make a note

Finally, be curious and ask questions ‚Äî even if they seem stupid. Take that first step and you will realize that almost everyone has the same set of questions. You will be appreciated a lot more for taking that initiative.

I hope this helps üòä
