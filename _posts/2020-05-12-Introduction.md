Well. I am not a writer. I would have liked to be, but Indian dreams are just not that easy, you know? (Hah, an awkward chuckle?). What can tell you that I am not a writer? Yep, I looked up random profiles on Medium and scrolled to find and read through their introductions. But I realized that writing a summary of their introductions won’t really do me any good.

I have tried maintaining a couple of blogs before and it’s just not worked out — mostly because it had 2 other pity readers who soon got bored.

I’m curious and I read and research about a lot of random things, and then quickly forget. I want to try and document some of the interesting things I come across, mostly around the internet industry — startups, marketing, books, data, growth, product, travel, a couple of more fancy terms etc. I also think that writing forces a cluttered mind to create a structure and tease out the essence of its thoughts and ideas. It’s like a little gym for the mind. I’d like to exercise some.

Have a great day!
